# Random_Image_Filter

This MATLAB script is used to apply a filter consisting of a set of 5 different image operations on an input image.
The image is randomly divided into 5 parts using random function. Each of these 5 parts is applied with different transformations from others.
The filters/transformations applied are:

    1. Log Transformation
    2.GreyScale Transformation
    3.Gamma Transformation
    4.Negative Filter
    5.Contrast Stretching.
  
The output is shown as a second new image along with the original image.

Also, a third image is also produced using the alpha blend of ratio 3:2 using the newly generated image and the original image.
