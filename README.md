# Random_Image_Filter
This R script is used to apply a set of 5 filters on an input image.
The image is randomly devided into 5 parts  using random function. Each of these 5 parts are applied with different different transformations from othes.
The filters/transformations applied are:

    1. Log Transformation
    2.GreyScale Transformation
    3.Gamma Transformation
    4.Negative Filter
    5.Contrast Streching
  
The out put is shown as second new image along with original image.

Also, a third image is also produced using alpha blend of ratio 3:2 using the newly generated image and original image.
